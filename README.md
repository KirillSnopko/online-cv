I have always wanted to be a engineer the person who develop and create something new. So I graduated from university as power engineer and then I started to find myself. I yearned to learn more, yearned to learn something different. And it's happened, when I started to learn programming, it was java. Since then, I can't get enough. I come across with new tools, tasks and new way of their solutions. I enjoy it. I love apply my knowledge and get the result. 
My specialty is bakend development, include quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem solving, achievement of the envisaged targets.
So far I have Java, C#, SQL, HTML, CSS, Git under my belt. I've experince witn asp.net framework and Spring framework, .ner core and Spirng boot. Also I worked with Jenkins, Docker container, MySQL, Oracle, MSSqlserver. I'm enthusiastically learning any other programming languages, frameworks, or tools.
